Parsed Input - Attributes:

   name                   image_id
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The image_id is an arbitrary string identifier that is associated with this image. The specific interpretation of it is mission-dependent, and it need not be unique to this image. For example, missions may use it as an image counter, a round-trip token indicating how to process the image, or a FSW-assigned value identifying the image.

   name                   image_id_2
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed

   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The mosaic_id attribute specifies which mosaic this image should be automatically included in. This does not constrain which mosaic(s) the image may be included in outside a pipeline environment.

   name                   mesh_id
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The mesh_id attribute specifies which terrain mesh this image should be automatically included in. This does not constrain which mesh(es) the image may be included in outside a pipeline environment.

   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Identifies which observation of many this data product pertains to.

   name                   parameter_table_number
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Specifies which table of parameters to use. Tables are necessarily defined in a mission- and instrument-specific manner.

   name                   image_type
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The image_type attribute specifies the type of image acquired. The intent is to distinguish between different kinds of image-related data that may differ in how they are interpreted. Some types are not standard images, but they are stored in an image structure. Examples include Regular, Thumbnail, Reference Pixels, Histogram, Row Sum, and Column Sum.

   name                   image_acquire_mode
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            _TBD

   name                   instrument_type
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The instrument_type attribute specifies the type of an instrument, for example IMAGING CAMERA, SPECTROMETER, IMAGING SPECTROMETER, or RADIOMETER
   nillable               true

   name                   instrument_mode_id
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The instrument_mode_id attribute provides an instrument-dependent designation of operating mode. This may be simply a number, letter or code, or a word such as 'normal', 'full resolution', 'near encounter', or 'fixed grating'. These types may vary by mission so the permissible values should be set by the mission dictionaries.

   name                   instrument_serial_number
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The instrument serial number element provides the manufacturer's serial number assigned to an instrument. This number may be used to uniquely identify a particular instrument for tracing its components or determining its calibration history, for example.

   name                   instrument_version_number
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The instrument_version_number element identifies the specific model of an instrument used to obtain data. For example, this keyword could be used to distinguish between an engineering model of a camera used to acquire test data, and a flight model of a camera used to acquire science data during a mission.

   name                   camera_product_id
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The camera_product_id attribute specifies a numeric identifier assigned by the instrument to this specific observation.

   name                   camera_product_id_count
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            The camera_product_id_count attribute specifies the number of times a specific camera_product_id has been used.

   name                   camera_model_serial_number
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Specifies the manufacturer's serial number for the camera for which the camera model was derived. This should match instrument_serial_number in most cases; generally speaking a mismatch should only occur during testing/development.

   name                   ops_instrument_key
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Preserved
   description            The ops_instrument_key attribute specifies the identifier or key for the instrument that was used during operations to look up instrument parameters or calibration. The key in Commanded_Parameters may differ from the primary ops_instrument_key in that the command may apply to a stereo camera as a pair (e.g. MCAMZ_BOTH) rather than a specific left or right eye.

   name                   horizon_mask_elevation
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The horizon_mask_elevation attribute specifies the elevation (in degrees) used as the horizontal cutoff in a mask file that prevents the horizon and sky features in the image from being processed. If this attribute is not present in the product label, no horizon mask was used.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Angle

   name                   derived_image_type_name
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The derived_image_type_name attribute specifies how to interpret the pixel values in a derived image (or colloquially, the type of the derived image itself). Valid values vary per mission depending on the products produced.

   name                   error_model_name
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The error_model_name attribute specifies the method or algorithm used to create the error estimate. Each mission will define their own set of possible values. Algorithms will be added over time. The initial value is MIPL_CONST_DISPARITY_PROJECTED_V1, which means an arbitrary constant disparity error is assumed (in ERROR_MODEL_PARMS), which is projected through the camera models to approximate an error ellipse, which is then projected to the XYZ or range/crossrange axes depending on the file type. 

   name                   linearization_mode
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode attribute specifies what kind of stereo partner was used to linearize the image (the process requires two camera models). 

   name                   linearization_mode_fov
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode_fov attribute specifies how the linearized camera model's field of view (FOV) as constructed (corresponding to the "cahv_fov" parameter in MIPL software). 

   name                   geometry_projection_type
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The geometry_projection_type attribute specifies how pixels in a file have been reprojected to correct for camera distortion, linearization, or rubber-sheeting (it is not the intent of this field to capture map projections). "Raw" indicates no projection has been done.

   name                   correlation_average_scale
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            Contains the "average" scale factor for the correlation. In other words, given the reference image, scale it by this amount to match the target image. This scale factor is not precisely defined; it is determined in different ways by different correlation programs. The intent is to provide a "hint" for users of the correlation without requiring a full set of transform coefficients.

   name                   correlation_overlap_percentage
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            Contains the percentage of the reference image that could overlap, geometrically speaking, with the target image. It does not indicate the actual correlation percentage, but rather what might correlate ideally. This can be used to distinguish, for example, nearly perfect correlation in a small overlapping area vs. very poor correlation over the entire image - both of which could have the same correlation_pixel_count). This percentage is not precisely defined; it is an approximation intended to facilitate culling of results.
   minimum value          0
   maximum value          100

   name                   correlation_pixel_count
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            Contains a count of the number of pixels that successfully correlated in the image.
   minimum value          0

   name                   stereo_baseline_length
   version                1.13
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The stereo_baseline_length attribute specifies the separation between the two cameras used for processing of the stereo image. 
   minimum value          0
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Length
