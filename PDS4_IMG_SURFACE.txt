   name                   image_id
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The image_id is an arbitrary string identifier that is associated with this image. The specific interpretation of it is mission-dependent, and it need not be unique to this image. For example, missions may use it as an image counter, a round-trip token indicating how to process the image, or a FSW-assigned value identifying the image.

   name                   mosaic_id
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The mosaic_id attribute specifies which mosaic this image should be automatically included in. This does not constrain which mosaic(s) the image may be included in outside a pipeline environment.

   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The image_type attribute specifies the type of image acquired. The intent is to distinguish between different kinds of image-related data that may differ in how they are interpreted. Some types are not standard images, but they are stored in an image structure. Examples include Regular, Thumbnail, Reference Pixels, Histogram, Row Sum, and Column Sum.
   permissible value - value meaning
      REGULAR - regular image
      THUMBNAIL - thumbnail image
      REF_PIXELS - reference pixels

   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            TBD

   name                   instrument_type
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The instrument_type attribute specifies the type of an instrument, for example IMAGING CAMERA, SPECTROMETER, IMAGING SPECTROMETER, RADIOMETER, etc.

   name                   instrument_mode_id
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The instrument_mode_id attribute provides an instrument-dependent designation of operating mode. This may be simply a number, letter or code, or a word such as 'normal', 'full resolution', 'near encounter', or 'fixed grating'. These types may vary by mission so the permissible values should be set by the mission dictionaries.

   name                   instrument_serial_number
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The instrument serial number element provides the manufacturer's serial number assigned to an instrument. This number may be used to uniquely identify a particular instrument for tracing its components or determining its calibration history, for example.

   name                   instrument_version_number
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The instrument_version_number element identifies the specific model of an instrument used to obtain data. For example, this keyword could be used to distinguish between an engineering model of a camera used to acquire test data, and a flight model of a camera used to acquire science data during a mission.

   name                   camera_product_id
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The camera_product_id attribute specifies a numeric identifier assigned by the instrument to this specific observation.

   name                   camera_product_id_count
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            The camera_product_id_count attribute specifies the number of times a specific camera_product_id has been used.

   name                   horizon_mask_elevation
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The horizon_mask_elevation attribute specifies the elevation (in degrees) used as the horizontal cutoff in a mask file that prevents the horizon and sky features in the image from being processed. If this attribute is not present in the product label, no horizon mask was used.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Angle

   name                   derived_image_type_name
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The derived_image_type_name attribute specifies how to interpret the pixel values in a derived image (or colloquially, the type of the derived image itself). Valid values vary per mission depending on the products produced.

   name                   error_model_name
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The error_model_name attribute specifies the method or algorithm used to create the error estimate. Each mission will define their own set of possible values. Algorithms will be added over time. The initial value is MIPL_CONST_DISPARITY_PROJECTED_V1, which means an arbitrary constant disparity error is assumed (in ERROR_MODEL_PARMS), which is projected through the camera models to approximate an error ellipse, which is then projected to the XYZ or range/crossrange axes depending on the file type. 

   name                   linearization_mode
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode attribute specifies what kind of stereo partner was used to linearize the image (the process requires two camera models). 
   permissible value - value meaning
      Nominal - The image was linearized using the nominal stereo partner at the same pointing (whether or not the partner image was actually acquired).
      Actual - The image was linearized using an actual stereo partner image, which may be at a different pointing or rover location (e.g. long-baseline or re-pointed stereo). The actual partner product(s) will be referenced by the Internal_Reference or External_Reference class(es) contained in the Stereo_Product_Parameters class.
      None - Linearization has not been performed.

   name                   linearization_mode_fov
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The linearization_mode_fov attribute specifies how the linearized camera model's field of view (FOV) as constructed (corresponding to the "cahv_fov" parameter in MIPL software). 
   permissible value - value meaning
      Min - Indicates the FOV is the intersection of the two cameras, which means some data are cut off and typically stretched horizontally, but there are no black areas.
      Max - Indicates the FOV is the union of the two cameras, which preserves the edges of the images but typically compresses the image horizontally, and creates black areas.
      Linear - Uses only the CAHV vectors, which tends to preserve the aspect ratio and scale of the original but both cuts off data and has black areas.
      None - Linearization has not been performed.

   name                   geometry_projection_type
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The geometry_projection_type attribute specifies how pixels in a file have been reprojected to correct for camera distortion, linearization, or rubber-sheeting (it is not the intent of this field to capture map projections). "Raw" indicates no projection has been done.
   permissible value - value meaning
      Raw - Indicates the image has not been reprojected. The original camera model is still in use.
      Linearized - Indicates reprojection has been performed to linearize the camera model (thus removing things like lens distortion). For images using the CAHV family of camera models, the image uses a CAHV model instead of CAHVOR or CAHVORE.

   name                   stereo_baseline_length
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The stereo_baseline_length attribute specifies the separation between the two cameras used for processing of the stereo image. 
   minimum value          0
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Length

   name                   line
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            The line attribute specifies the line number in the image.
   minimum value          1

   name                   sample
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_NonNegative_Integer
   description            The sample attribute specifies the sample number in the image.
   minimum value          1

   name                   x_position
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The x component of a Cartesian position vector.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Length

   name                   y_position
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The y component of a Cartesian position vector.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Length

   name                   z_position
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The z component of a Cartesian position vector.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Length

   name                   pointing_model_name
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The pointing_model_name attribute specifies which of several "pointing models" were used to transform the camera model based on updated pointing information. These updates are typically derived from mosaic seam corrections. This attribute and the associated Pointing_Model_Index classes define what the updated pointing information is, providing enough information to re-create the camera model from calibration data. If present, this attribute overrides the default pointing based on telemetry. The special value "NONE" shall be interpreted the same as if the attribute is absent (i.e. the default pointing model should be used). New model names can be created at any time; the models themselves should be described in a mission-specific ancillary file. See also the geom:solution_id attribute within the geom:Camera_Model_Parameters class.

   name                   pointing_model_solution_id
   version                1.10
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The pointing_model_solution_id attribute specifies the identifier of the pointing correction solution used to derive the model specified via the enclosing Pointing_Correction_Parameters class. This identifier should also appear in the pointing correction file referenced by the Data_Correction_File. If there is only one identifier in the correction file, then pointing_model_solution_id may be omitted. The pointing_model_solution_id attribute may be reused in the context of pointing corrections, although uniqueness is recommended. The pointing correction solution ID namespace is separate from the coordinate system namespace.

   name                   index_name
   version                1.0
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The index_name attribute supplies the formal name for the associated value in a group of related values.

   name                   index_value_real
   version                1.0
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The index_value_real attribute provides the real number value as named by the associated index_id or index_name.

   name                   Geometry_Projection_Parameters
   description            The Geometry_Projection_Parameters describes the geometric projection or warping the image has undergone. It is not the intent of this class to describe map projections, but rather image warps such as linearization (stereo epipolar alignment), geometric sensor correction, or rubber-sheeting. If present, a linearization partner image can be referenced using either an Internal_Reference or External_Reference.

   name                   Stereo_Product_Parameters
   description            The Stereo_Product_Parameters class describes the conditions under which stereo analysis was performed. This includes items such as the stereo baseline (separation between the cameras) and what partner image(s) were used for stereo analysis. If present, stereo partner images can be referenced using either an Internal_Reference or External_Reference.
